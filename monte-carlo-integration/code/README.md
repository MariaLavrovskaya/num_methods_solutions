## Monte-Carlo Integration 
---
This is improved solution to the example provided in the 'Numerical Recipes 3rd edition'. 

#### Problem description
Suppose that we want to estimate given integrals along three dimensions (7.7.5 on p. 400). We also want to find the weights and the position of the center of mass of an object (as given in the example). 

#### Improvements
We have improved the readability and supported it with line-by-line explanations to ease the learning process. 

#### Future plans 
- Adding visualization
